                Constant Field Data can never change after the initial assignment.
                Constant Field Data is implicitly static.
                Constant Field Data must be known at compile time. 
                the initial value assigned to the constant must be specified at the time you define the constant.

                public readonly double PI;
                read-only field cannot be changed after the initial assignment.
                the value assigned to a read-only field can be determined at runtime.
                not implicitly static.
                can legally be assigned within the scope of a constructor, but nowhere else.
